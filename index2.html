      Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (1931–2015) was one of India’s most beloved scientists and the
      11th President of India. Known as the <strong>“Missile Man of India”</strong> for his work in developing
      ballistic missile and space technologies, he inspired millions with his humility, intelligence, and
      dedication to the nation.

    <h2>What I Adore About Him</h2>
    <p>
      I deeply admire Dr. Kalam for his unwavering belief in the power of youth and education.
      Despite his humble beginnings, he rose to become one of India’s greatest scientists
      and leaders without ever losing his simplicity. His ability to combine science with a
      compassionate vision for humanity continues to motivate me every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      His life teaches that no dream is too big if one has dedication, hard work, and integrity.
      He showed that success is not just about personal achievements, but about uplifting others.
